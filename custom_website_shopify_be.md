## Executive Summary

You have a custom Figma design ready and want to build an ecommerce website for 15-20 products with vendor management capabilities. This document outlines three different approaches to implement your vision, each with different benefits, costs, and timelines.

---

## Your Three Options

### Option 1: Custom Shopify Theme (Recommended)
**Convert your Figma design into a Shopify theme**

```
Figma Design → Custom Shopify Theme → Shopify Platform
```

#### How It Works
- We convert your Figma design into Shopify's theme language (Liquid)
- Your design lives within Shopify's structure
- All ecommerce features are built-in

#### Pros
- ✅ All Shopify features included (payment, shipping, taxes)
- ✅ Easy vendor management with apps
- ✅ Lower development cost
- ✅ Single platform to manage

#### Cons
- ❌ Some design compromises may be needed
- ❌ Limited by Shopify's structure
- ❌ Certain animations/interactions may not be possible

#### Cost & Timeline
- **Development Cost**: $1,000 - $3,000
- **Monthly Cost**: $128 - $178 (Shopify + apps)
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

---

### Option 2: Headless Shopify
**Build your exact design with custom code, use Shopify for backend**

```
Figma Design → Custom Next.js Website → Shopify Backend (invisible)
```

#### How It Works
- We build your website exactly as designed using React/Next.js
- Shopify runs invisibly in the background for products and orders
- Customers see only your custom website
- Checkout happens on Shopify (for security)

#### Pros
- ✅ 100% design freedom - exactly as in Figma
- ✅ All custom animations and interactions possible
- ✅ Reliable Shopify backend for orders
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Easy to scale later

#### Cons
- ❌ Slightly higher development cost
- ❌ Two systems to understand (frontend + Shopify)

#### Cost & Timeline
- **Development Cost**: $5,500 - $8,500
- **Monthly Cost**: $100 (Shopify + hosting)
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

---

### Option 3: Fully Custom Solution
**Build everything from scratch without Shopify**

```
Figma Design → Custom Website → Custom Backend → Database
```

#### How It Works
- Build entire ecommerce system from ground up
- Custom database for products and orders
- Custom payment integration
- Custom everything

#### Pros
- ✅ Complete control over everything
- ✅ No third-party limitations
- ✅ Can add any feature imaginable

#### Cons
- ❌ Highest cost
- ❌ Longest development time
- ❌ Need to build features Shopify provides free
- ❌ Higher maintenance cost
- ❌ Security and PCI compliance complexity

#### Cost & Timeline
- **Development Cost**: $8,000 - $10,000
- **Monthly Cost**: $500+ (hosting, services, maintenance)
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why not just use Option 1 (Shopify Theme) if it's cheaper?
**A:** While cheaper, you may need to compromise on your design. If your Figma design has unique layouts, animations, or interactions, these might not be possible within Shopify's theme system.

### Q: Is Option 2 (Headless) complicated to maintain?
**A:** No, once set up, it's quite simple. Products are managed in Shopify's user-friendly admin, and the website rarely needs updates unless you want design changes.

### Q: When should we consider Option 3 (Full Custom)?
**A:** Only when you need features that Shopify cannot provide, like complex B2B workflows, custom pricing algorithms, or when you expect 1000+ products and 50+ vendors.

### Q: Can we start with Option 2 and move to Option 3 later?
**A:** Yes! The frontend you build for Option 2 can be reused if you later build a custom backend, making migration easier.

### Q: What about SEO with the headless approach?
**A:** Next.js provides excellent SEO capabilities. Your site will rank well in Google with proper implementation.
